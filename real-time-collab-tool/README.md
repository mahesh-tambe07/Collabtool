# Real-Time Collaboration Tool

This project is a real-time collaboration tool built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to collaborate in real-time on various tasks and documents.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### Client

The `client` directory contains the React application.

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file for the React application.
- **src/components/App.js**: The main component that manages state and renders child components.
- **src/App.js**: The entry point for the React application.
- **src/index.js**: Renders the App component into the root DOM element.
- **src/styles/App.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the App component.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for the client-side application.

### Server

The `server` directory contains the Node.js and Express backend.

- **controllers/index.js**: Exports controller functions for handling requests and responses.
- **models/index.js**: Exports Mongoose models defining the data structure.
- **routes/index.js**: Exports routes for the server-side application.
- **app.js**: Sets up the Express application, including middleware and routes.
- **server.js**: Entry point for the server-side application.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for the server-side application.
